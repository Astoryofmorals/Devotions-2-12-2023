Goodbye bigotry
Goodbye bigotry

Didn't know what time it was
The hatred were high
I leaned back on my redemption

Some hater was layin' down
Some jock 'n' roll 'lotta cruel
He said





Then the loud Q's did seem to hatee
Came at us like a thundering voice on a wave of lies
That weren't no trolls that was hazy antisemtics lies

There's a klansman waiting in the dark
He'd like to come and kill us
put a shotgun to our head


There's a klansman waiting in the shadows
He's told not to fight us 
'Cause they think thier above us

He told me let the Jews to die
Let the children all die
Let all infidels die


I had to hate on someone so I picked on Jew.
Hey, that's antisemtic towards the Jew eww 
Switch on the 4chan right to bugallooo

Look out your texts i can see your alt-right
If we can lie we'll steal israel alright 
Don't tell your coppa or he'll wanna fight

There's a klansman waiting in the dark
He'd like to come and kill us
But he'd shoot our minds

There's a klansman waiting in the shadows
He's told us not fight us
'Cause he thinks he's above us.

He told me, "Let the children die 
Let the infidels die
Let all the lovers die

Klansman waiting in the dark
He'd like to come and kill us
But he thinks he'd shoot our minds

There's a klansman waiting in the shadows
He's told us not to fight us.
'Cause he thinks he's above us.

He told me, "let the children all die.
Let the infidels all die.
Let all the lovers die.
